## Description: 
- Let's [**look**](https://github.com/Iamtripathisatyam/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/BasicPythonScripts/PC%20Cleaner/pc_cleaner.py) at a Python script that will place all of your files in the appropriate folder.
- This script will first list all of the files and place them in folders based on their extensions, such as "**.pdf**" which will be placed in the **PDFs folder**, and so on for all of the files.
- Finally, all of the files will be placed in their proper directories.

## Procedure to follow: 
- Import **OS** module
- Using the **chdir** function, change the location where the files will be imported.
- List all of the files using the **listdir** function, and then delete any files that don't have an extension like any folder.
- Run a loop for all of the files, putting them in the appropriate folders based on their extensions.
- Finally, each file will be placed in its own folder.
